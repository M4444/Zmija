# Zmija
Zmija (snake in Serbian) was created in 2013. It was my first crack at making a game with the newfound knowledge of C.
It's a Windows terminal based game. When it starts it resizes the terminal window. It also changes the font so it has
the same width and hight which is important so that the snake doesn't appear to speed up when moving vertically.

Even though it's a simple game, it's still fun to play. Hope you enjoy ^^

### Menu
When the game starts a menu will appear with the following three options:

`1` starts a game where you can pass through walls

`2` starts a game where you die if you hit walls

`0` quits the game

### Controls
Use `8`, `5`, `4`, `6` on the numpad as up, down, left and right.

`P` pauses, `Z` toggles the sound and `Esc` quits and brings up the menu.

### How it looks:
